    <h2 align="center">E-Doc</h2>
    <h5 align = "center">One stop solution for the safest doctor patient interaction in the current times. <br>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, basic necessities such as visiting a hospital is highly risky. <br/>We have come up with a product that can help people in the rural areas to meet doctors without compromising on their safety.

### Our Inspiration
One of our team members’ grandmother is diabetic. This is his story.
Living in a metro city, visiting a hospital for a change in my grandmother’s insulin dosage was horrific. The crowd in and around the hospital is humongous. I fell sick the very next day and was terrified that I would test positive. Fortunately, it was just a scare. But this experience put things in perspective. After having so many resources at our disposal, this is our condition. 
What would a peasant in a village without a proper medical facility even hope to do?
 
### What it Does
E-Doc cabin has an array of sensors that measure various values of the patient and feed it to the doctor.
The doctor will be connected live and also can dispense pills at his will to the patient.
After each patient visit the cabin will be sanitized by itself.
